Codes for the project on the alignment of radio sources in LOFAR.



Mainly kept for legacy value. Most useful codes can be found in './value_added_catalog_1_1b_thesis_cutoff069/scripts/'
where for example mc.py implements the monte carlo simulations of the random angle sample, and statistics_mc.py calculates the significance of non-uniformity at different angular scales using KD-trees for quick NN-finding.
