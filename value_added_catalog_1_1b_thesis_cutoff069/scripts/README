All scripts are meant to be ran in the directory they are present in.

First run

NN_source_filtering.py 
multi_gaussian_source_filtering.py

These produce 
/data1/osinga/value_added_catalog1_1b/source_filtering/NN/all_NN_sources.fits 
and 
/data1/osinga/value_added_catalog1_1b/source_filtering/MG/all_multiple_gaussians.fits

Which are, respectively, all the NN sources that made the cut, and all the MG sources that made the cut
(can be duplicates)


Then run 

merge_value_added_catalog.py

Which produces the biggest_selection, and all (ir)relevant subsets of this in 

../value_added_selection.fits
../value_added_selection_MG.fits 

etc.
